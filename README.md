# Reinforcement Learning Code

This is a repository where I'll be uploading my attempts at writing RL code.
Hopefully, they will be compatible with OpenAI's Gym environments, so that
they may be easily tested in "real" or at least stanard environments.

So far, we have only *policy evaluation* methods:
* Monte Carlo State and Action Value function approximation
* TD(0) State and Action Value function approximation
* TD(lambda) State and Action Value function approximation
